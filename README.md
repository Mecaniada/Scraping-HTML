# Scraping-HTML
Scraping HTML Data with BeautifulSoup #Coursera
"In this assignment you will write a Python program to use urllib to read the HTML from the data files below, and parse the data, extracting numbers and compute the sum of the numbers in the file"

This is my assigment to Course 'Using Python to Access Web Data' made by Dr.Chuck for Coursera from University of Michigan.
I highly suggest you to try and make for yourself the code because that's how you can learn something new and understand mode about Python.
